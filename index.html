    <h2>Scientific Experience (Selected)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Wave Energy Harvesting</strong> (ESGI180, University of Birmingham, 2024) - Research Collaboration:<strong> Collaborated with 15 professors and post-docs from different parts of
the world. Also, presented our work in front of 70 people. Only women in the whole group.</strong> This work considers the design of a wave energy converter employing the WITT device: a
machine that is able to convert motion in all 6 degrees of freedom into electrical power. Various
designs for housing the WITT device inside a buoy are investigated with the aim of converting the
forcing from low-frequency ocean waves to a higher-frequency motion at which the WITT
generates power most effectively. By modelling the rigid-body motion of a buoy in response to a
provided ocean wave forcing and the dynamics of the internal mechanisms within the buoy, we
explore how nonlinear oscillation dynamics may achieve the desired frequency amplification. <strong> My contribution involves a simulation about maximising the frequency of the
Witt device using an optimisation technique </strong>.
Below is the optimisation simulation</p>

      <li><p><strong>River Bathymetry Estimation</strong> (SAMBa, 2024) - This research introduces a novel method for estimating river bathymetry using available datasets,
bypassing extensive field measurements. Utilizing hydraulic geometry and shallow water
equations, we develop a model for non-uniform flow conditions. We compare two optimization
techniques: nonlinear least squares and the Nelder-Mead method. While nonlinear least squares
can overfit noisy data, the Nelder-Mead method proves more robust and efficient. Our trapezoidal
river model highlights the importance of precise parameter calibration. Findings show the
Nelder-Mead method significantly outperforms nonlinear least squares in noisy data
environments, enhancing flood prediction accuracy. Below are the simulations. </p> <img src="irp.png" alt="Optimisation Simulation for Bathymetry" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin-top: 10px;"> </li>
      <li><p><strong>Fire Spread Modelling</strong> (workshop - BeZero Carbon, 2024) - The partner we worked with is BeZero Carbon. The primary problem revolves around the
development of a stochastic model to understand the spread of forest fires and the underlying
causes. I used an agent-based model and real data to tackle this challenge and also used
Repast(python toolkit) for simulations. You can see the simulations below.</p>

      <li><strong><p>Contaminant Transport Modelling</strong> (Worshop - Wessex Water, 2023) - The industry partner we worked with is Wessex Water. The challenge they proposed is to
improve the modelling of the concentration of harmful bacteria in a river network, to
provide users of the river with live information on water quality. Wessex Water is interested
in finding out how long it takes bacteria to be carried between the sources and the sample
location. we used graph-based models and worked on real data to approach this
challenge.</p></li>

    <h2>Innovative Math Program</h2>
    <p>Founder & Lead Educator - Innovative Math Program, Tamil Nadu, India (05/2021 ‚Äì 09/2023)</p>
<p>As the Founder and Lead Educator of the Innovative Math Program, I designed and launched a revolutionary online mathematics curriculum aimed at students from grades 1 to 8. The program introduces a unique, five-level educational framework that replaces traditional paper-and-pen learning with interactive games, engaging activities, riddles, and storytelling. This dynamic approach fosters a deep and joyful understanding of mathematical concepts. Over 500 students have successfully completed the program, including approximately 400 children from orphanages across Tamil Nadu. Many of these students advanced well beyond their expected grade levels, with some achieving proficiency in solving Grade 8‚Äì9 level problems. The program has also empowered students to earn accolades in international competitions such as the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and Mathcounts, underscoring the effectiveness of this innovative teaching methodology.</p>

<p>Beyond research, I have always been driven by a sense of purpose rooted in service and empowerment. In the UK, I transformed my own personal pain into purpose by supporting autistic students and those who had discontinued their studies due to trauma and depression. By using mathematics as a healing and empowering tool, I helped them rebuild confidence, reignite curiosity, and reconnect with learning in special education settings.</p>

  <h2>üë©‚Äçüéì About Me</h2>
  <div class="about-content">
    <p>
      I was born and raised in a disaster-prone village in India, where I began working at the age of 8 with a dream much bigger than my surroundings. From a very young age, I imagined becoming a mathematical researcher‚Äîsomeone who solves global challenges with creativity and purpose. Life wasn't easy, but every hardship strengthened my resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a first-generation graduate from an underprivileged background, and the journey to where I am today has been anything but linear. Transitioning from my village to the UK for fully funded higher education came with emotional trauma, bias, financial struggles, cultural shocks, food adaptation issues, and health challenges. But I never gave up. Instead, I reached out to acedemics, took on extra projects, and slowly rebuilt my strength through collaboration, learning, and passion for research. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most defining moments of my journey was participating in ESGI180‚Äîan elite European study group with industry‚Äîwhere I was the <strong> only woman in a team of 20 academics </strong>. I contributed a double-pendulum optimization model for wave energy harvesting and was one of only 11 contributors featured in the final publication. Presenting my shortlisted idea in front of 70 international academics was a reminder that no matter where I come from, I belong in rooms where innovation happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond research, I‚Äôve always believed in turning pain into purpose. In the UK, I taught autistic students and those who had discontinued education due to depression and trauma. Through mathematics, I helped them rebuild confidence and reconnect with learning. This work was not just tutoring‚Äîit was healing through numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in India, I founded the <strong>Innovative Math Program</strong>, which now reaches over 500 orphan children. This initiative eliminates traditional rote learning and introduces mathematics through games, stories, and hands-on activities. I designed this program from scratch and implemented it across orphanages, empowering children to perform far beyond their grade level and even succeed in international competitions like IMO and Mathcounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey is not just about mathematics‚Äîit's about resilience, service, empowerment, and finding magic in learning, even in the darkest times. I believe mathematics is not only a scientific tool but also a powerful force to transform lives, especially those who‚Äôve been told they can‚Äôt.
